We focus on providing sustainable  solutions for all types of pest issues. In addition to offering IPM (<strong>Integrated Pest  Management</strong>) services for pests such as  cockroaches, rats, mice. Occasional Invaders and ants, Vital has developed and  implemented creative solutions for other pests including fruit flies, birds,  bats and bed bugs. Our IPM standards and innovative approach were developed  through years of experience working with some of the most highly audited  businesses and research </p>
      <p>facilities in the country. And it’s the <em>“never stop until the problem is solved” </em>attitude that makes</p>
      <p>the difference.</p>
        <p>Our standards of inspection, proper ID of  pests and the most effective treatments and monitoring</p>

      <p>Through a Managed Pest  Solution, we develop a program specific to your industry’s audit requirements and customer requirements, then we design, implement, track and trend a  strategy that will be consistent and provide long term success. We start by  eliminating all existing pest activity. Then we set up a preventative program  to monitor for any introduced pests and eliminate them as they occur using our  environmentally friendly IPM solutions. We prevent pest introduction by making  your facility less conducive to pest infestations by communicating structural, storage and sanitation improvements as well as the implantation of a pest  sighting log that will reduce the possibilityof pest harbourage and introduction.  Then follow up and QA visits begin</p>
      <p>with a focus on communication and a  collaborative approach that ensures a sustainable long term result.</p>
