      <p><em><strong>What our customers are saying</strong></em></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p> We had a serious issues beginning at our restaurants that I had been trying to get our current company to solve. Unfortunately the problem was getting worse and there was no urgency on our current providers part so the problem was dramatically getting worse. </p>
      <p> I brought on Vital Pest and I immediately saw an improvement. They made good on their promise and kept coming until the problem was solved. There was no extra fees just allot of hard work to solve the problem.<br />
        It took about 45 days for it to get solved and now We haven't had any pest sighting in over 4 months! I wouldn't trust my pest control to anyone else.</p>
      <p> Thank you Johnny you definitely delivered as promised!</p>

      <p>We hired Vital Pest because we heard from a friend that they would solve any problem we may currently have and prevent any future problems. Johnny was an awesome guy to work with, he was very knowledgeable and friendly. And he definitely did what he said he would do. We have no pest issues and we know as long as we have Vital Pest we never will! </p>

      <p>I am very glad I chose Vital Pest to come take care of my bat problems.  We could hear them scurrying in the ceiling when in bed at night. We actually like the bats around because of the bug problem in my area. Just not in the ceiling.<br />
        Johnny knew what to do and picked the right time to seal up all the access points for the bats to make sure we didn't seal any in, and he mounted a bat box near by for us so the bats didn't have to go far to find their new home.</p>
      <p>Good Job Vital Pest, Thank you very much,</p>
      <p>Fred S. Fairfield, Ca.</p>

      <p>Thank you Johnny!</p>
      <p> I am enclosing my first payment for my quarterly service plan you started yesterday. I found two ants in my kitchen sink this morning and they were NOT moving normally. They definitely seemed effected by the pesticides. I say KA-POW to those ant colonies!</p>
      <p> Thank you for helping me regain whatever sanity I have left.</p>
      <p>Sincerely,</p>
      <p>Donna Gentile</p>
