			<p><strong>FAQ's</strong> -</p>
			<p>How many wineries should we visit in a day? That's really up to you and the amount of time you want to spend. Our experience has been that 3-4 wineries and lunch makes for a memorable day. After that palate fatigue starts to set in.</p>
			<p>Do I need to make appointments? That depends on the winery. Some require appointments no matter the group size according to their use permit or in wanting to keep the experience intimate. Others do not for group sizes under 6. It's always a courtesy to call the wineries when the group size is 6 or more.</p>
